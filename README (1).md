# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Workbench

This project contains a series of notebooks that demonstrate the complete workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning modeling. It is ideal for showcasing foundational to intermediate-level techniques in data science using Python.

## üß† Project Scope

- Perform detailed data exploration and cleaning
- Derive meaningful insights through visualizations
- Apply machine learning models for predictive analysis

## üìÅ Notebooks

### 1. `analysis_project.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on:
- Data import and preprocessing
- Handling null/missing values
- Visual exploration of data distributions, trends, and correlations
- Feature engineering for model readiness

### 2. `ml_project.ipynb`
This notebook covers:
- Model selection and training
- Supervised ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC)
- Final predictions and model interpretation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìà Key Takeaways

- Shows a structured pipeline for transitioning from data understanding to actionable predictions.
- Offers visualization-backed insights along with reproducible code.
